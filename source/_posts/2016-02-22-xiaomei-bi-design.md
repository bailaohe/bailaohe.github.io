## Concepts

a dataframe can be modeled as a sequence of transformations closure over an init *raw* dataframe

the sequence os ops can be lazily computed and any dataframe can be specified as a snapshot at a position

the data-content of the frame can only be generated by computed along the sequence, but the schema of the dataframe can be deduced 

widget includes:

* config:
	* schema-key (from schema service)
	* access-rule
	* parameters
	* query
* front-end:
	* JS (data-access api)
	* CSS
	* resources
